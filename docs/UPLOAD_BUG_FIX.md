# File Upload Bug Fix Documentation

## Problem Description
The document management system had a critical bug where uploaded files sometimes appeared as 0 bytes in the documents page. This occurred because:

1. **No actual file upload handling**: The API was not processing `$_FILES` array
2. **Missing file validation**: No checks for upload errors or file size
3. **Incomplete database schema**: Missing `file_size` and proper `upload_date` handling
4. **No file system operations**: Files were never actually moved to the uploads directory

## Root Cause Analysis
The original implementation only handled file metadata passed via POST parameters, but never processed actual file uploads using PHP's `$_FILES` superglobal.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Document Class (`classes/Document.php`)
- ✅ Added `file_size` parameter to `addDocument()` method
- ✅ Added `upload_date` with `NOW()` timestamp in database insertion
- ✅ Updated `getAllDocuments()` and `getDocumentsByCategory()` to include `file_size` in SELECT queries

### 2. Complete API Rewrite (`api/documents.php`)
- ✅ **File Upload Validation**: 
  - Check `$_FILES['file']` exists and has content
  - Validate `$_FILES["file"]["error"]` for upload errors
  - Ensure `$_FILES["file"]["size"] > 0` to prevent 0-byte files

- ✅ **Security Enhancements**:
  - File type validation (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, JPG, PNG only)
  - File size limit enforcement (10MB max)
  - Filename sanitization to remove dangerous characters
  - Input sanitization using `htmlspecialchars()`

- ✅ **File System Operations**:
  - Automatic creation of `/uploads/` directory
  - Unique filename generation to prevent conflicts
  - Proper file moving with `move_uploaded_file()`
  - Cleanup on database insertion failure

- ✅ **Database Integration**:
  - Prepared statements for all database operations
  - Transaction-like behavior (file cleanup on DB failure)
  - Proper error handling and user-friendly messages

### 3. Frontend Updates (`documents.php`)
- ✅ Modified form submission to use `FormData` with actual file upload
- ✅ Changed field names to match new API expectations
- ✅ Proper file object passing to API

### 4. Security Infrastructure
- ✅ Created secure `/uploads/` directory with:
  - `.htaccess` file preventing script execution
  - MIME type configuration
  - Directory browsing disabled
  - Security headers for file downloads

## New Helper Functions Added

### `getUploadErrorMessage($errorCode)`
Converts PHP upload error codes to user-friendly messages.

### `sanitizeFileName($filename)`
Removes dangerous characters from filenames while preserving readability.

### `generateUniqueFileName($filename, $directory)`
Prevents filename conflicts by appending numbers or unique IDs.

## Database Schema Requirements
Ensure your `documents` table includes these fields:
```sql
- id (auto-increment primary key)
- document_name (VARCHAR)
- category (VARCHAR) 
- description (TEXT)
- filename (VARCHAR) - original filename
- file_size (BIGINT) - file size in bytes
- file_url (VARCHAR) - relative path to file
- upload_date (TIMESTAMP) - when file was uploaded
```

## Validation Flow
1. **File Upload Check**: Verify file was uploaded via `$_FILES`
2. **Error Validation**: Check `$_FILES["file"]["error"]` for upload issues
3. **Size Validation**: Ensure `file_size > 0` and within limits
4. **Type Validation**: Only allow safe file extensions
5. **Security**: Sanitize filename and inputs
6. **File System**: Move file to secure uploads directory
7. **Database**: Insert metadata only after successful file save
8. **Cleanup**: Remove file if database insertion fails

## Error Messages
The system now provides specific, user-friendly error messages for:
- Missing files
- Upload errors (size limits, permissions, etc.)
- Invalid file types
- Empty files (0 bytes)
- Server-side failures

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with various file types (valid and invalid)
2. Test with empty files (should be rejected)
3. Test with oversized files (should be rejected)
4. Test with duplicate filenames (should auto-rename)
5. Verify files appear with correct sizes in the documents list
6. Test security by attempting to upload PHP files (should be blocked)

## Security Features
- ✅ File type whitelist (no executable files)
- ✅ Directory browsing disabled
- ✅ Script execution disabled in uploads folder
- ✅ Input sanitization and prepared statements
- ✅ Unique filename generation
- ✅ Proper MIME type handling

This fix ensures that files are properly validated, securely stored, and accurately represented in the document management system.
